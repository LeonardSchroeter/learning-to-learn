# Machine learning of gradient-based optimization methods

This repository holds the code for the experiments in my bachelor's thesis with the above title.
The tests were run with python version 3.9.5.
The needed dependencies can be installed with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The experiments are listed in main.py. 
The class `LearningToLearn` in src/train.py contains the core learning to learn algorithm.
